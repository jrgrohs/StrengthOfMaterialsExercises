## Problem Statement

A beam of length L = 10 ft is constructed by nailing together two boards with dimensions b = 3.5 in. and h = 1.5 in. The beam is subjected to a concentrated load F = 100 lb as shown. Each nail can withstand a shear load of 100 lb. What is the minimum permissible spacing between nails?
