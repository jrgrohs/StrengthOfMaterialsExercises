# Problem 10.5 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A simply supported beam is constructed from two wooden boards as shown. The beam supports a concentrated load F = 10 kN. If length L = 5 m  and cross-section dimensions b = 40 mm and h = 20 mm, determine the shear stress in the glue that holds the boards together.

The beam cross section is two stacked rectangles The top rectangle has a base of h and a height of h, and the bottom rectangle has a base of b  and a height of h."}
