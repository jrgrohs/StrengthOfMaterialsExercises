# Problem 2.2 {.unnumbered}

# Problem Statement
Two cylinders are stacked on top of one another and two forces are applied at the top surface and at the joint between the cylinders as shown. If L<sub>1</sub> = 3 in., L<sub>2</sub> = 4 in., F<sub>A</sub> = 500 lb, and F<sub>B</sub> = 200 lb, find the total deflection in the stack of cylinders. Assume E = 30 x 10<sup>6</sup> psi for both cylinders.
