# Problem 2.3 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement

A plastic cylindrical peg is constrained by a metal cap as shown. An axial load of F = 40 lb is applied to the peg. If d<sub>1</sub> = 0.5 in and d<sub>2</sub> = 0.9 in, determine the normal stress in the peg. Assume the axial load is evenly distributed across the peg and that the metal cap is fixed and does not move.
