# Problem 4.12 {.unnumbered}

## Problem Statement
A rectangular bar is pulled in tension by a load P in the x-direction. The bar deflects by d<sub>1</sub> = 0.0350 in and d<sub>2</sub> = 0.0012 in, in the x- and y-direction, respectively. The length in the x-direction is 5 in, and the length in the y direction is 1 in. What is the Poisson's ratio of the material? The z-direction deflection is not known.
