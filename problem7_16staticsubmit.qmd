## Problem Statement

Plot the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the loading shown. Assume w = 10 lb/ft, M = 200 lb-ft, and L = 10 ft. What is the maximum absolute shear force and maximum absolute bending moment?


![Figure 1: A beam is subjected to a distributed load and a moment with supports at A and B. ](images/322.png){fig-alt="A beam is subjected to a distributed load, w between B and C. A moment is applied clockwise at the left end of the beam. The distance between A and B is L and the distance between B and C is L."}
