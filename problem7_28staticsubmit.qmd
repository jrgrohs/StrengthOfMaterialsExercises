## Problem Statement

Plot the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the loading shown. Assume w<sub>1</sub> = 50 kN/m, and w<sub>2</sub> = 10 kN/m. What is the maximum absolute shear force and maximum absolute bending moment?


![Figure 1: A beam is subjected to two distributed loads.](images/333.png){fig-alt="A beam is subjected to a distributed load, w1 between B and C. Another distributed load is applied between A and D. The distance between A and B is 40 cm, the distance between B and C is 20 cm, and the distance between C and D is 40 cm."}
