## Problem Statement

A beam with a rectangular cross-section is subjected to a distributed load w = 3 kN/m as shown. The maximum allowable bending stress in the beam is 7 MPa. If length L = 5 m and the cross-sectional area of the beam is A = 0.025 m<sup>2</sup>, determine the required width (b) of the cross-section.
